Davvott's version of DrumBot utilizes python sonic and the pretty cool Sonic Pi.

Sonic Pi seems pretty awesome, check it out if you're into that kind of thing. 

## v1.0
Just some basic code to call from drumbot/ and play the sounds. 

Took me a while, but I'm stoked I did it. 

Still have to organise proper BPM. Maybe after dinner.
