## v.01
Fixed an old game of life file to render AutomataBot fetch requests. 

Built on Tkinter. Should be good to go for Python 3.6

## TODO
* Implement birth and survival constraints
* Implement generations 'runtime' 
* Export game-state to post back for the Challenge glory!
* Maybe after dinner...
