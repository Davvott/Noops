## v.05
Major refactor, separating logic out of GUI into AutomataBot class. 

A lot of work to tidy up old crappy code! 

Built on Tkinter. Should be good to go for Python 3.6

## TODO
* Implement generations 'runtime' 
* Export game-state to post back for the Challenge glory
* (Check if I'm getting it correct)

This set of rules is possibly one of the coolest things I've seen in a while.
